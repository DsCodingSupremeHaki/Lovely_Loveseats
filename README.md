My first project on Codecademy.com, working with Python.

# Furniture Store Inventory & Customer Calculator

---

## Project Overview

This is a simple Python script that simulates a basic inventory and sales calculation for a small furniture store. It defines a few furniture items with their descriptions and prices, calculates the total cost for a customer, applies sales tax, and then itemizes their purchases.

This project was created as a beginner exercise to practice:
* Declaring and using **variables**
* Performing basic **arithmetic operations**
* **Concatenating strings**
* Using **print statements** for output

## How to Run

1.  **Save the code:** Copy the provided Python code into a file named `furniture_store.py` (or any `.py` extension you prefer).
2.  **Open a terminal/command prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the `furniture_store.py` file.
3.  **Run the script:** Execute the following command:
    ```bash
    python furniture_store.py
    ```

The script will then print the customer's itemization and their total cost to the console.

## Code Description

The script includes:
* Descriptions and prices for `Lovely Loveseat`, `Stylish Settee`, and `Luxurious Lamp`.
* A predefined `sales_tax` rate.
* Calculations for `customer_one`:
    * Adds the cost of `Lovely Loveseat` and `Luxurious Lamp` to their total.
    * Generates a string summarizing their purchased items.
    * Calculates and applies sales tax to their total.
* Prints the final itemized list and total cost for `customer_one`.

## Future Enhancements (Ideas for Growth!)

As a learning exercise, here are some ideas for how this project could be expanded:

* **User Input:** Allow the user to input which items a customer wants to buy.
* **Multiple Customers:** Create a way to handle multiple customers and their separate transactions.
* **Inventory Management:** Track the quantity of each item available and decrease it after a purchase.
* **Functions:** Organize the code into functions (e.g., `calculate_total()`, `print_receipt()`).
* **Error Handling:** Add checks for invalid input.
* **Data Structures:** Store item information in lists or dictionaries for easier management.
